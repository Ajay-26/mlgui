A nice GUI for Machine Learning

This repo aims to provide people with a GUI to be able to perform machine learning/data analysis by writing little to no code at all.

To run this code, clone the repo and run the following:
cd mlgui
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run python3 src/main.py

In the future we hope to make this a command on the terminal where a user can run "MLGUI activate" and have the same effect as "poetry run python3 src/main.py".
We also wish to eventually port this to windows so that users can click on the executable and open a browser window to use it, because we anticipate that our 
key audience would primarily consist of windows users
